The students will present, review and discuss papers. \nAs groups, they will also conduct a research project over the course of the semester. In addition, there will be several guest lectures by researchers and professional experts in the area.', metadata={'source': './CSCI2270_Info.txt'}), Document(page_content='We will study how these services handle massive datasets and billions of requests per day.
